        The park is large and has many things to do. Frankly, I'd say the best way to enjoy Busch Gardens is to spend at least 2 days there — one day for the rides and shows, another for the animals and enjoying the lush gardens. But, if you're like most people who visit the park, your stay is for just 1 day.</p>

        <h2 align="center">The Scenery in Tampa</h2>
        <p> All the beaches feature soft, white sand and the warm, calm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. So the decision really comes down to the location and  nearby amenities. If you are looking for a full-service beach with cabanas, restaurants, water sports and entertainment, then the ever-popular Clearwater Beach is a good choice. A favorite of spring-breakers, it's the center of all the action and home to Pier 60 that hosts a daily sunset festival. </p>

            Tampa comes to life after the sun goes down, offering fantastic hangouts for any type of atmosphere. Dance the night away at raging nightclubs, watch the big game at sports bars, or attend an exhilarating concert.
